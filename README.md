> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for creating YOURLS extensions

This script help to create YOURLS v2.0+ extensions in a second.


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Install the Generator

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a YOURLS extension.

To install `generator-yourls-extension` from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-yourls-extension
```

Finally, initiate the generator and follow instructions:

```bash
$ yo yourls-extension
```
