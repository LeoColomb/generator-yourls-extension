Getting Started
---------------

### What is this generator?

This generator helps you to bootstrap the creation of a YOURLS extension such as:
* Plugin — [How to](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/wiki/Plugins)
* Theme — [Explanations](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/wiki/Themes)
* Translation — [Documentation](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/wiki/Translations)

### What is Yeoman?

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell
him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in
the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for 
him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive.
*Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Install the Generator

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can
think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application
you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a YOURLS extension.

To install `generator-yourls-extension` from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-yourls-extension
```

Finally, initiate the generator and follow instructions:

```bash
$ yo yourls-extension
```
