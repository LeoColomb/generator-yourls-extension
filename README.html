<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>What is Yeoman?</h3>

<p>Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.</p>

<p>Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the <a href="https://npmjs.org">npm</a> package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. <em>Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.</em></p>

<p><code>
$ npm install -g yo
</code></p>

<h3>YOURLS Extension Generator</h3>

<p>Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.</p>

<p>To install generator-yourls-extension from npm, run:</p>

<p><code>
$ npm install -g generator-yourls-extension
</code></p>

<p>Finally, initiate the generator:</p>

<p><code>
$ yo yourls-extension
</code></p>
